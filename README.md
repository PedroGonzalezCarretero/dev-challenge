# Weather Widget App Challenge

This is a full-stack app challenge to build a weather widget that displays weather 
information from weatherapi.com. The backend is built with ExpressJS and the frontend is 
built with ReactJS. The project consists of three containers: postgres-db, tgx-backend, 
and tgx-frontend, which can be run with Docker Compose.

> **Note**
> The goal of this challenge is to know the skill level of the participant, so it's ok if you can't make it fully work.

If you have any doubt, find errors or want to give us feedback about this particular project, please, open an issue so we can review it.

## Getting Started

To start the project, first fork and clone this repo to your computer. Then run the following command:

```bash
docker compose --env-file=./envs/base.env up
```

If you are using Windows, please modify the path accordingly.

The backend is exposed on port 9000 for REST APIs, and the frontend is exposed on port 3000.

## Backend

The backend is responsible for fetching weather information from weatherapi.com and 
storing it in the database. It uses latitude and longitude provided by the user to 
fetch weather information. The backend should fetch the weather information every 
10 minutes and store it in the database. The database design is up to the challenger.

## Frontend

The frontend consists of two weather widgets, one horizontal and one vertical. 
The widgets should display the latest weather information stored in the database. At minimum should display:

- Weather condition (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc)
- Temperature in CÂº
- Hour of lecture
- Name of the city

In addition to the weather widgets, the frontend should also display a history of 
weather readings. When a user selects a reading from the history, 
the corresponding weather information should be displayed in the widgets.

  WeatherAPI -->> Backend: Return weather data
  Backend ->> Database: Store weather data
  Frontend ->> Database: Fetch weather data
  Database -->> Frontend: Return weather data
  Frontend ->> Frontend: Display weather widgets and history
  User ->> Frontend: Select a weather reading
  Frontend ->> Frontend: Display weather data for the selected reading
```


## Conclusion

This is a challenging full-stack app that requires the challenger to use their knowledge 
of ExpressJS, ReactJS, and database design to create a functional and visually 
appealing weather widget. The challenge can be modified as needed to meet specific requirements. 
The challenger's documentation, code style, and testing will be evaluated as part of the 
challenge.

Once the challenge is completed please send us a mail to jobs@taggify.net with an updated CV and the forked project to revision.
